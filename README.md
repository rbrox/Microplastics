In this project we try to create a software model to compute or estimate the probable dissovled microplastics and penultimate elements in sea water. The based on microplastics in the sea by

The model inputs:

- the pH of the sea water
- the temperature of the sea water
- the depth of the sea water
- the lattitude and longitude of the sea water

The model outputs:

- the probable dissovled microplastics in sea water
- the probable dissovled penultimate elements in sea water
